//* Iterate Through All an Array's Items Using For Loops

//? We have defined a function, filteredArray, which takes arr, a nested array, and elem as arguments, and returns a new array. elem represents an element that may or may not be present on one or more of the arrays nested within arr. Modify the function, using a for loop, to return a filtered version of the passed array such that any array nested within arr containing elem has been removed.

// create an array with some numbers
// declare an empty array
// all the numbers greater than 5 should be pushed into the empty array

function filteredArray(arr, elem) {
  let newArr = [];
  // Only change code below this line
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i].indexOf(elem) === -1) {
      newArr.push(arr[i]);
    }
  }
  // Only change code above this line
  return newArr;
}

console.log(
  filteredArray(
    [
      [3, 2, 3],
      [1, 6, 3],
      [3, 13, 26],
      [19, 3, 9],
    ],
    3
  )
);
